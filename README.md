# Welcome to EnCounter
This is a minor project I made to count, it runs on a json database as to not use any MySQL databases.

THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A DISCORD BOT!!!
The project is way too complicated for what it does, but it's fun. If you wish to use it, you're free to copy the code.
Just remember to add your token file. I didn't include that one because... well... it contains my token :D

## tl;dr
Add the token file before use: "Token.ts / Token.js"
